## ‚ú®&ensp;Quick Explanation

1. When I reach **250** sponsors, another half of my repositories will be released to public. 
2. If you [Request Access](https://github.com/sponsors/aeonSolutions "Request Access") and [Become A GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/aeonSolutions "Become A GitHub Sponsor") you will get **everytime directly access** to the source code & projects I release. 
3. After becoming a sponsor, you should get an **invitation via email to the private repository**, if the invite doesn't come instantly - wait some time.

## üíñ&ensp;What Is Sponsorware?

Sponsorware means that new source code projects are released publicly if a specific target is met by the community, in the meantime existing sponsors can already access these new source code projects.

Let's say the target is to reach 250 more sponsors on GitHub.
If this target is met, all the new uploaded projects are made public so that everyone in the community can access them. After this a new target will be created for all future projects.

**3 Advantages Of Sponsorware**

- The Source Code is in longterm **Open-Source & "We have Free Education"** for all the people.
- The Content Creators **don't need to create primarily Private Courses** to finance them.
- The Content Creators can **fully focus on providing free education** on open platforms such as Facebook, Discord, and WhatsApp for their community.

## üéôÔ∏è&ensp;Why Sponsorware?

I strongly believe that "Sponsorware" is the future for all Software Content Creators. Next to selling highly specialized courses, Sponsorware is for us as content creators important so that we have another income stream that helps us support the mission of free education instead of focusing primarily on selling private courses and making knowledge & education closed for a small privileged group of people.

## ‚úå&ensp; How Am I Going To Use Sponsorware?

1) I set a target for the community f.e. to reach 250 new sponsors.
2) I am going to upload new projects that will be all private, however, sponsors can still access all projects at any time.
3) If the target of f.e. 250 new sponsors is reached, half of my private projects will be made public.
4) Start over with 1. again

## ü§ì&ensp;FAQs

### 1. Why Is The Source Code Not Available On GitHub?

The source code is available! To get the source code, **you need to request access first** and you also need to fill the form. See for more details below A.

**A. Request Access**

You need to [request access first](https://github.com/sponsors/aeonSolutions "Request Access") and you also need to fill out the form.

&ensp;[<img alt="JohannesMilke | REQUEST" height="40px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/web-johannesmilke.appspot.com/o/other%2Fgithub%2Fsponsored%2Fbutton_request.png?alt=media" />](https://github.com/sponsors/aeonSolutions "REQUEST")


### 2. Why Didn't I Get An Email, Even If I Have Sent Already A Request On Your Website?

After filling out the form you should receive a confirmation email that you need to confirm. Simply click on the button "Confirm Your Subscription" within the email.

*Check out also your spam folder, in case you didn't receive this confirmation email. Alternatively, search for the email subject "Request Access: Confirm Your Email" within your email client.* Also, in case the email goes to your spam folder, the subscription link might not be clickable therefore simply move the mail out of your spam into the inbox and try again to click on the button. 


### 3. Why Do I Request The Source Code Even If I Don't Want To Become A Sponsor?
Once the community target of f.e. 250 new sponsors is reached, half of my private projects will be made public. All people who have requested the source code and have not become a sponsor yet will be informed that the source code of some of the private projects is publicly available now.

In case you don't want to wait until the source code becomes publicly available in the future simply [Request Access](https://github.com/sponsors/aeonSolutions "Request Access") and [Become A GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/aeonSolutions "Become A GitHub Sponsor") so that you get every time directly access to all the projects & source codes I release.

### 4. Why Is The GitHub Access Link Not Working Even If I Am A Sponsor?
The access link is working! First of all, you need to accept the invitation from GitHub.  After this, you will have access to all GitHub repositories.
